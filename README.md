**Markdown Clips** is a collection of Basic and Extended Markdown syntax snippets, for use with Panic Inc's [Nova](https://nova.app) IDE.

Proudly made, with love, in the UK.

## Installation

### Nova's Extension Library
You can install this extension through the Extension Library. Search for *Markdown Clips* and press `Install`.

### Manual method
Alternatively you can download the extension from the GitHub repository, double click the file and opt for installation when Nova prompts you.

## Usage Guide

**Please note:** Don't forget to set your document syntax to *Markdown*, so the extension can work its magic. (You can set the default syntax in Nova's Editor settings).


### Autosuggest and autocomplete
Markdown Clips will make suggestions as you type words and phrases into the Nova editor. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move up and down the autosuggest list, and press `Enter` to insert your selection.

You can also invoke clip suggestions using related syntax. For example, typing a right facing chevron `>` will autosuggest all block-quote clips and typing a left facing square bracket `[` will autosuggest all link clips.

| Clip Group | Keystroke Trigger |
|-----------|-----------|
| Block-quotes     | > |
| Comments         | < |
| Headers          | # |
| Images           | ! |
| Links            | [ |
| Tables           | `|` (Pipe) |

Some keystrokes are protected by Nova and don't trigger autocomplete. For these I've assigned different single character triggers.

| Clip Group | Keystroke Trigger |
|-----------|-----------|
| Code              | § |
| Formatting Tools  | _ (Underscore) |
| Lists             | = |

### Common formatting keystrokes
Text can be made **bold** or *italic* using the familiar `Ctrl+B / Cmd+B` and `Ctrl+I / Cmd+I` commands. Markdown Clips will also apply these formatting styles to your selected text too.

### Sidebar Gallery

You can also open the *Clips* sidebar to visually browse the library. Nova will let you double click, or click and drag into the editor.
