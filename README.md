**Markdown Clips** is a collection of basic, extended, and GitHub Flavoured Markdown syntax snippets, for use with Panic Inc's [Nova](https://nova.app) IDE.

Proudly made, with love, in the UK.

## Installation

### Nova's Extension Library
You can install this extension through the Extension Library. Search for *Markdown Clips* and press [Install](nova://extension/?id=uk.co.seanosullivan.markdownclips&name=Markdown%20Clips).

### Manual method
1. Download the extension from [the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips).
2. Double click the *.novaextension* file you download and opt for installation when Nova prompts you.

## Usage Guide

)
>
>Don't forget to set your document syntax to *Markdown*, so the extension can work its magic. (You can set the default syntax in Nova's Editor settings if you want new files to begin in the Markdown format).

### Automatic suggestions, or drag and drop. Your choice.

![Autosuggest for Nova](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips/main/gif-autosuggestdragdrop.gif "Autocomplete example for Markdown Clips in Nova")

Markdown Clips will make suggestions as you type words and phrases into the Nova editor. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move up and down the autosuggest list, and press `Enter` to insert your selection.

You can also open the *Clips* sidebar to visually browse the library. Nova will let you double click, or click and drag into the editor.

### Trigger clips with Syntax
![Markdown Clips Trigger on Syntax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips/main/screenshot-triggeronsyntax.png "Autosuggest example with Trigger on Syntax in Markdown Clips")

You can also invoke clip suggestions using related syntax. For example, typing a right facing chevron `>` will autosuggest all block-quote clips and typing a left facing square bracket `[` will autosuggest all link clips.

| Clip Group        | Keystroke Trigger |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Block-quotes      | >                 |
| Code              | §                 |
| Comments          | <                 |
| Formatting Tools  | _ (Underscore)    |
| GitHub Alerts     | ±                 |
| Headers           | #                 |
| Images            | !                 |
| Links             | [                 |
| Lists             | =                 |
| Tables            | `|` (Pipe)        |

Some keystrokes are protected by Nova and don't trigger autocomplete. For these I've assigned different single character triggers.

### Use common formatting keystroke shortcuts
Text can be made **bold**, *italic*, and <ins>underlined</ins> using the familiar `Cmd+B`, `Cmd+I`, and `Cmd+U` commands. Markdown Clips will apply these formatting styles to selected text too.
