## Version 1.6
### 🎁 What's New?
#### GitHub Alerts (GitHub Flavoured Markdown)
Markdown Clips now contains clips for the five GitHub Alert styles; Caution, Important, Note, Tip, and Warning. As always they can be selected from the Clips sidebar, they'll be suggested automatically as you type, and can be triggered using the new `±` keystroke.

#### Collapsable sections (Open and Closed)
Clips for collapsable sections, both open and closed, are now supported. They each contain a line break after the 'summary' for better Markdown formatting support within the section itself.

#### Superscript and Subscript
Two new clips have been added for superscript and subscript.

#### Underlined formatting
For those of you who like to underline text, Markdown Clips now supports the familiar `Cmd+U` keyboard command. The formatting will apply to any selected text too.



## Version 1.5
### 🎁 What's New?
#### Trigger on Syntax and Trigger on Shortcut
Markdown Clips will now autosuggest clips using related syntax. For example, typing a right facing chevron `>` will autosuggest block-quote clips and typing a left facing square bracket `[` will autosuggest link clips.

| Clip Group        | Keystroke Trigger |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Block-quotes      | >                 |
| Code              | §                 |
| Comments          | <                 |
| Formatting Tools  | _ (Underscore)    |
| GitHub Alerts     | ±                 |
| Headers           | #                 |
| Images            | !                 |
| Links             | [                 |
| Lists             | =                 |
| Tables            | `|` (Pipe)        |

Some keystrokes are protected by Nova and don't trigger autocomplete. For these I've assigned different single character triggers.

#### New Clips - Comments
Two additional clips have been added, for in-line and multi-line comments.

#### Improved autosuggest accuracy
Some of the clips have been renamed to improve autosuggest accuracy.

### 👾 Bug Fixes
*Header ID* clip now has a trigger (which was missing before)



## Version 1.4
### 🎁 What's New?
#### New Clips
* Additional Clips for embedding Local and internet video. (Thanks to the [GitLab Markdown Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/markdown-guide/) documentation for this one).
* An additional Clip for adding collapsible sections to your documents
* An additional Clip for inserting images with URLs

#### An icon refresh
The extension icon has been updated to fit in a little better with the macOS design language



## Version 1.3
### 🎁 What's New?
#### An icon refresh
The extension app logo has been updated, to be more colourful.

### 🛠️ Changes
#### Keystroke trigger alterations
A handful of triggers have been changed, to make clip activation more natural with your writing.

  * The keystroke `>` invokes the list of block quote options
  * The keystroke `-` invokes text formatting options
  * The keystroke `|` invokes the list of table options

You can still bring these up using their descriptive names though. (For example, if you start typing the word *block quote*, the block quote options will appear.)



## Version 1.2
### 🎁 What's New?
#### Header ID's
Added *Header ID's*. These are useful if you want to generate links directly to headings in resulting HTML markup.

### 🛠️ Changes
#### Commands support has been removed
Commands support for **bold** and *italic* removed, as I've integrated the formatting with the clips. Same power, but easier to wield! ([Repo Issue 1: Format selection with keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips/issues/1)).



## Version 1.1
### 🎁 What's New?
#### Bold and Italic are now Commands
Bold and italic are now published as Commands, so you can select existing text and change its formatting. 

You can use the menu, *Editor > Markdown Clips*, to do this or alternatively bind the commands to custom keyboard mappings within *Preferences > Key Bindings > Extensions*).

### 👾 Bug Fixes
Typing the word *boot* and pressing 'Enter' would replace with a blockquote.
