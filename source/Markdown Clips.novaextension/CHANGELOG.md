## Version 1.1
* [**New**] Bold and italic are now published as Commands, so you can select existing text and change its formatting.
    * You can use the menu, *Editor > Markdown Clips* to do this
    * Alternatively, bind the commands to custom keyboard mappings within *Preferences > Key Bindings > Extensions*)
* [**Fixed**] Typing the word *boot* and pressing 'Enter' would replace with a blockquote.
