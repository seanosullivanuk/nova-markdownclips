## Version 1.2
* [**Changed**] Commands support for **bold** and *italic* removed, as I've integrated the formatting with the clips.Same power, but easier to wield! ([Repo Issue 1: Format selection with keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips/issues/1)).
* [**New**] Added *Header ID's*. These are useful if you want to generate links directly to headings in resulting HTML markup.

## Version 1.1
* [**New**] Bold and italic are now published as Commands, so you can select existing text and change its formatting.
    * You can use the menu, *Editor > Markdown Clips* to do this
    * Alternatively, bind the commands to custom keyboard mappings within *Preferences > Key Bindings > Extensions*)
* [**Fixed**] Typing the word *boot* and pressing 'Enter' would replace with a blockquote.
