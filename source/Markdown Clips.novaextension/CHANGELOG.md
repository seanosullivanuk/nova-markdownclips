## Version 1.3
**[Changed]**
A handful of triggers have been changed, to make clip activation more natural with your writing.

* The keystroke `>` invokes the list of block quote options
* The keystroke `-` invokes text formatting options
* The keystroke `|` invokes the list of table options

You can still bring these up using their descriptive names though. (For example, if you start typing the word *block quote*, the block quote options will appear.)

**[Changed]**
The extension app logo has been updated, to be more colourful.

## Version 1.2
**[Changed]** Commands support for **bold** and *italic* removed, as I've integrated the formatting with the clips.Same power, but easier to wield! ([Repo Issue 1: Format selection with keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips/issues/1)).

**[New]** Added *Header ID's*. These are useful if you want to generate links directly to headings in resulting HTML markup.

## Version 1.1
**[New]** Bold and italic are now published as Commands, so you can select existing text and change its formatting.
    * You can use the menu, *Editor > Markdown Clips* to do this
    * Alternatively, bind the commands to custom keyboard mappings within *Preferences > Key Bindings > Extensions*)

**[Fixed]** Typing the word *boot* and pressing 'Enter' would replace with a blockquote.

## Version 1.0
