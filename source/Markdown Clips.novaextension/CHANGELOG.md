## Version 1.4 🎉
**New**
* Additional Clips for embedding Local and internet video. (Thanks to the [GitLab Markdown Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/markdown-guide/) documentation for this one).
* An additional Clip for adding collapsible sections to your documents
* An additional Clip for inserting images with URLs

**Changed** 
* The extension icon has been updated to fit in a little better with the macOS design language

## Version 1.3 🥳
**Changed** 
* A handful of triggers have been changed, to make clip activation more natural with your writing.

  * The keystroke `>` invokes the list of block quote options
  * The keystroke `-` invokes text formatting options
  * The keystroke `|` invokes the list of table options

  You can still bring these up using their descriptive names though. (For example, if you start typing the word *block quote*, the block quote options will appear.)

* The extension app logo has been updated, to be more colourful.

## Version 1.2 🎁
**New**
* Added *Header ID's*. These are useful if you want to generate links directly to headings in resulting HTML markup.

**Changed** 
* Commands support for **bold** and *italic* removed, as I've integrated the formatting with the clips. Same power, but easier to wield! ([Repo Issue 1: Format selection with keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/seanosullivanuk/nova-markdownclips/issues/1)).

## Version 1.1 🪅
**New**
* Bold and italic are now published as Commands, so you can select existing text and change its formatting.
  * You can use the menu, *Editor > Markdown Clips* to do this
  * Alternatively, bind the commands to custom keyboard mappings within *Preferences > Key Bindings > Extensions*)

**Fixed** 
* Typing the word *boot* and pressing 'Enter' would replace with a blockquote.

## Version 1.0 🥳
