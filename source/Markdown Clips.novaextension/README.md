## Installation

### Nova's Extension Library
You can install this extension through the Extension Library. Search for *Markdown Clips* and press `Install`.

### Manual method
Alternatively you can download the extension from the GitHub repository, double click the file and opt for installation when Nova prompts you.

## Usage
### Autocomplete and keyboard shortcuts

**Markdown Clips** uses *triggers* to assist with autocomplete. Unlike some other markup languages, the triggers are only part of the words so they don't interrupt your writing.

There is *keyboard shortcut support* for some of the formatting options. (e.g. Cmd+B for **bold** and Cmd+I for *italic*).

### Commands

Bold and italic are now published as Commands, so you can select existing text and change its formatting.
* You can use the menu, *Editor > Markdown Clips* to do this
* Alternatively, bind the commands to custom keyboard mappings within *Preferences > Key Bindings > Extensions*). In the example below, I've bound them to *Cmd + Shift + B* and *Cmd + Shift + I*
